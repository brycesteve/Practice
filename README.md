# Practice

This is an Apple ecosystem app for my own personal use.  It tracks Simple and Sinister+ workouts.  The plus refers to the addition of Push/Pull Supersets.

The workouts are tracked using the Apple Watch and then synced with HealthKit.  Basic stats are shown in the iOS app.  

*NOTE: This app is for my own personal use.  You are welcome to copy all or any part of it.  However, as I have no intention of releasing it, there may well be bugs I haven't had the time to fix*

## Motivation

I got fed up of losing track of sets.  I was also curious to see what I could do with the data from HealthKit.  So, this is the end result.

I do fix bugs, as I come across them, but this is a personal/hobby project, so it's not in "active development".
