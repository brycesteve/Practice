# Practice

This is an Apple ecosystem app for my own personal use.  It tracks Simple and Sinister+ workouts.  The plus refers to the addition of Push/Pull Supersets.

The workouts are tracked using the Apple Watch and then synced with HealthKit.  Basic stats are shown in the iOS app.  

*NOTE: This app is for my own personal use.  You are welcome to copy all or any part of it.  However, as I have no intention of releasing it, there may well be bugs I haven't had the time to fix*
